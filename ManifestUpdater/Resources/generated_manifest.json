    "Description": "This is my first (and not the last I hope) attempt to add some more reactivity for backgrounds, part one is for Prologue. Great thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/users/867208]RomeoReject[/url], who translated mod to english, so now all english-speaking people can try it too. If you see errors in text, feel free to tell me about it, i'll fix it. If you wanna translate it to some other languages, you're welcome.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Mostly its \"I know this already\" stuff, like Navi Officer knows about Navigators or Psyker knows about danger of the warp. Psykers got some discipline-related reactivity, at least 1 for all disciple. \"Choosing Conviction\" scene got some changes (texts only, sorry again, animations are too complex for me). And 2 more points where you can get new epilogue bookpage. :)\n<br />\n<br />Попытка добавить чуток реактивности для предысторий, часть первая - Пролог. В основном, хоть какой-то способ убрать тупые вопросы типа \"Что такое Навигатор?\" для нависов, немножко \"типичных\" реакций, чуть-чуть мест, где у псайкеров работает дисциплина, теперь все дисциплины имеют минимум по одной точке. Несколько переписала сцену с выбором конвикшена (катсцену не трогала, это для меня слишком сложно). Ну и добавила парочку мест с досрочным получением эпилога. :)\n<br />\n<br />Installation guide:\n<br />1. [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases/tag/v1.14]MicroPatches mod[/url] - required. Create a directory MicroPatches in UnityModManager directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader), and unpack archive with latest release there.\n<br />2. Unpack archive with my mod into Modifications directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader).\n<br />\n<br />3. Create \"OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json\" file in the &lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\n<br />4. Open it with notepad and paste { \"EnabledModifications\": [\"AddReactivityProlog\"] } \n<br />OR\n<br />3. [url=https://github.com/CasDragon/ModFinder/releases/]Modfinder[/url] - get latest release, unpack it somewhere in your computer, run and manage your RT mods.\n<br />\n<br />Updating guide:\n<br />Delete mod directory with previous version before installing new one, because I renamed almost all files (for more compatibility with next official updates).",

    "Description": "#  Adepta Sororitas Sabbat-Pattern Helmets\nA mod for Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG. Adds several Sabbat-pattern helmets for Argenta (or mod-added Sororitas background RTs) throughout the game.\n\n## Overview\nThis mod adds the familiar Sabbat-pattern helmet employed by the Adepta Sororitas. Owlcat did initially showcase Argenta wearing one in the pre-release trailers, but for whatever reason this was removed and no longer exists in the game files. This is a new model made by me (although a hooded version uses one of Owlcat's hood models).\n\nThe mod contains four helmets. The first two - the standard base version and a hooded Celestian version - are available in chapters 2 and 4, respectively, via the Drusian vendor. The remaining two are paired with Argenta's mutually exclusive quest armours, available at the end of chapter 4. Additionally, this mod makes a minor tweak to the final cutscene/conversation of this quest to ensure that Argenta actually equips the armour she gains.\n\n## Installation\nThis is an Owlmod, made using the Unity template supplied by Owlcat. Currently the game has a bug that prevents Owlmods from working. To fix this, you ***must*** install the Unity Mod Manager-based mod [MicroPatches](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases) by microsoftenator2022. You can install it manually or via [ModFinder](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModFinder/releases/latest).\n\nTo install this mod, first make sure you have run the game at least once. Download the archive and extract it into:\n\n%LocalAppData%Low\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\Modifications\\\nEach Owlmod needs to be in its own sub-folder in the Modifications folder.\n\nAfterwards, you need to edit OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json in the base Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader folder in a text editor (Notepad++ recommended). It should look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n\"$id\": \"1\",\n\"SourceDirectories\": [],\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\"],\n\"DisabledModifications\": []\n}\n```\n\nIf you have other mods, list them in quotes separated by commas. For example:\n\n```\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n```\n\nYou can move individual mods from the ActiveModifications section to the DisabledModifications section if you want to disable them without physically removing them.\n\nAlternatively, use [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146) to install the mod.\n\nIt should be fine to install the mod in an existing game at any point right up to completing Argenta's quest in chapter 4 (or after if you're willing to use Toybox to manually spawn the helmets).\n\n## Known Issues\nThere will be some log spam after the final cutscene of Argenta's personal quest (although the vanilla version also has a bunch of error logs) seemingly due to the game trying to equip Argenta before she has rejoined the party. I did try tweaking the scene to prevent this but to no avail. Despite the error logs, everything seems to work fine. She will be wearing the armour and associated helmet for the path she's on when she returns to you (check the images tab for a screenshot).\n\nThe mod will be incompatible with any other mod that edits the CommandAction9 and CommandAction10 blueprints for the Argenta_Q2_ArgentaReturn_KTC cutscene. It's an unfortunate limitation of the way Owlmod blueprint patches work. It will probably also break (at least until I update it) if Owlcat patch those blueprints or otherwise alter the scene at some point to fix the vanilla bug.\n\nThis mod creates a save dependency! You won't be able to load a save that used it if you later uninstall the mod.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to the modders on the Owlcat Dicord, but particularly microsoftenator2022 and Kurufinve, for helping to coach me through my ineptitude in order to get the mod working.\n",

    "Description": "# EnhancedControls - mod for Warhammer 40000: Rogue Trader\n\nAdds UX related stuff. \n\nIf you're a user, downloads are on the right. See **Releases** link.\nYou can see detailed mod description on [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/14) or [Steam workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114200965) (or in Workshop-description.txt file).\n\n\n## How to build\n\n1. Get the usual tools (Visual Studio and .NET development stuff)\n2. Clone the repo\n3. Build. And then Build again. Project looks up your RT installation dir from your game logs (so you need to run the game at least once).\n\nThat's it. On Build output is copied into UMM folder in appdata.\n\n\n## How to contribute localization\n\nAfter installing the mod localization files are in `Localization` folder.   \nIf you named mod install folder `EnhancedControls` then full path to them would be `%userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\UnityModManager\\EnhancedControls\\Localization`\n\nEnglish localization is in `enGB.json`\n\nCopy this file and rename new file according to the language you're translating into.\nRussian  - `ruRU.json`    \nGerman   - `deDE.json`   \nFrench   - `frFR.json`   \nChinese  - `zhCN.json`    \nSpanish  - `esES.json`   \nJapanese - `jaJP.json`   \n\n(If your system is set to hide file extensions and you don't see `.json`, then ignore that part)\n\nOpen your new localization file with any text editor - but for best results use something with syntax highlight - Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or something else.   \nChange **Text** properties to translate things.  \nStart the game in chosen language to see the effect. Or switch the language in settings, the mod will reload your changes.\n\nSend me translation file if you want me to include your translation with the mod.\n",

    "Description": "Expanded Archetypes is a project to add new abilities and talents to the existing character class archetypes in Rogue Trader. The goal is to provide novelty, added variety, and more interesting build decisions.\n<br />\n<br />The version 1.0 goal was to add one ability and three talents to each of the original four tier 1 archetypes. I am trying to loosely theme these around the idea of trees, related features that build out a clear but missing niche for those paths. I would then like to move on to either doubling those additions or moving on to tier 2 in the next release. I am more focused on tier 1 though as I feel that is where broader choices belong while tier 2 is intended for specialization.\n<br />\n<br />The Soldier gets a shotgun tree. \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Pistol Whip ability lets a ranged weapon-equipped soldier mix in some melee up close.\n<br />[*]The Butt Strike talent gives additional damage to Pistol Whip when using a two-handed ranged weapon.\n<br />[*]The Street Sweeper talent makes pushbacks on shotgun blasts occur even on a miss.\n<br />[*]The Gut Shot talent makes shotgun attacks on adjacent targets automatically hit.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Operative gets a sneaky tree:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Disengage ability lets the operative safely extract themselves from melee and lower their target priority\n<br />[*]The Backstab talent increases damage while the Operative is the lowest priority target\n<br />[*]The Marked Target talent leaves one exploit intact when abilities would otherwise remove them all\n<br />[*]The Vanish talent expands the Perfect Spot ability by making the operative the lowest priority target when Perfect Spot is used\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Officer gets a heroic self-buff tree.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Deeds Not Words is an ability that gives a full stat buff based on Fellowship.\n<br />[*]The Shield of Courage talent is a Deeds upgrade that adds armor to the buff\n<br />[*]The Guide My Hand talent is another Deeds buff that makes attacks automatically hit.\n<br />[*]The Audacity talent lets the officer substitute Fellowship for Agility in calculating Dodge.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Warrior gets a flamer tree.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Fuel for the Fire is an ability that triggers instances of burning on nearby targets.\n<br />[*]Pyromaniac is a talent that refunds 1 ap the first time a flame or melta weapon is used in a turn.\n<br />[*]Conflagration is a talent that adds stracks of burning based on ballistic skill.\n<br />[*]Enveloping Flames is a talent that increases the minimum damage of flame and melta weapons based on ballistic skill.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />This is still a work in progress.Feel free to use the comments to suggest more additions to archetypes in the future.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />\n<br />You will need to install [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install it would be to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]Modfinder[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />If not using ModFinder, you will need to unzip the folder into your Game's Modifications folder.

The path will be similar to C:&#92;Users&#92;Me&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader&#92;Modifications\n<br />\n<br />Once the folder is there, you may need to edit your OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json file. This is one level up from the mod's folder. It needs to look something like:\n<br />\n<br />[code]﻿{\"$id\":\"1\",\"SourceDirectories\":[],\"EnabledModifications\":[\"ColdTraderOccupation\",\"jhColonyProjects\",\"jhExpandedArchetypes\"],\"ActiveModifications\":[\"ColdTraderOccupation\",\"jhColonyProjects\",\"jhExpandedArchetypes\"],\"DisabledModifications\":[]}\n<br />[/code]\n<br />\n<br />You will need to add the two entries for jhColonyProjects following the format above. Once this file is edited you can start your game and you should see the mod in the in-game mod tool (not the built in Unity Mod Manager)",

    "Description": "I happened to notice that, as of the current date/patch (1.2.19), 3 unique flamers have an attack that is not affected by the Flame Weapon Expert talent: Fiery Retribution (unique #3 attack), Purging Fury (#2 attack), &amp; the Toxic Flamer (also the #2 attack.) This resulted in a situation where those attacks cost 2 AP regardless of whether you had the talent or not. I assume this is a bug (despite the latter 2 appearing to have a normal 2nd attack, in actuality all 3 affected attacks have a unique ID, which were not on the current list of attacks the talent affects), but I can't say that definitively.\n<br />\n<br />Easiest way to install IMO is drag &amp; drop the Zip into the bottom panel of the Rogue Trader version of Modfinder.\n<br />\n<br />I'm hoping that Owlcat will fixt this issue themselves so none of us have to worry about this, but it is VERY unlikely I will devote any time to keeping this up to date unless I happen to be actively playing RT at that point in the future.\n<br />\n<br />A rather niche fix in the grand scheme of things that I made mostly for myself, but I thought someone out there might find useful. It happens to be my first &amp; probably? only mod I'll ever publish. Hopefully someone else will get a use out of it!",

Fix for: Some effects that should be using the caster's stats incorrectly use the target's stats and vice-versa.\n- Ignore TurnBasedEventsTrigger on features on non-party companions. Fixes the \"Infinite Seize The Initiative\" bug\n- Fixed EGSAchievementsManager NullReferenceExceptions\n- Ignore Steam Achievements with Null ID\n- Lowered the severity of missing save file warnings (\"DLC has no status in the DLCCache. Defaulting to unavailable\") no longer prints a stacktrace\n- Silenced keybinding conflict messages\n- Skip LoadAssigneeAsync - prevents internal QA error message\n",
